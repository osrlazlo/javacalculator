# javacalculator
Calculator made with Java
Can handle add, sub, mult, div, exp, negative numbers, parentheses, and virtually infinitely long expressions
Works by taking input as a string, parsing operands and operators into arrays, and performing operations in order (PEMDAS) until reaching final result

Note that code is not optimized, only functional, and about 20% of the lines are console outputs for troubleshooting purposes

Things to add in the future :
- input for pi
- basic trig operations
