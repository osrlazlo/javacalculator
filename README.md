# javacalculator
Calculator made with Java
Can handle add, sub, mult, div, exp, negative numbers, parentheses, and virtually infinitely long expressions
Works by taking input as a string, parsing operands and operators into arrays, and performing operations in order (PEMDAS) until reaching final result

Things to add in the future :
- input for pi
- basic trig operations
- modify removeParenthesis() to look for 1st closed ) instead of last open (, that way it is not necessary to search through the entire array on every call
